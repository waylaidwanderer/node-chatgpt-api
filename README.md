## Updates
<details open>
<summary><strong>2023-03-01</strong></summary>

**Support for the official ChatGPT model has been added!** You can now use the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model with the official OpenAI API, using `ChatGPTClient`. This is the same model that ChatGPT uses, and it's the most powerful model available right now. Usage of this model is **not free**, however it is **10x cheaper** (priced at $0.002 per 1k tokens) than `text-davinci-003`.

See OpenAI's post, [Introducing ChatGPT and Whisper APIs](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis) for more information.

~~To use it, set `modelOptions.model` to `gpt-3.5-turbo`, and `ChatGPTClient` will handle the rest.~~
The default model used in `ChatGPTClient` is now `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
You can still set `userLabel`, `chatGptLabel` and `promptPrefix` (system instructions) as usual.

I've added an experimental `ChatGPTBrowserClient` which depends on a reverse proxy server that makes use of a Cloudflare bypass, allowing you to talk to ChatGPT (chat.openai.com) without requiring browser automation. All you need is your access token from https://chat.openai.com/api/auth/session.

As always, please note that if you choose to go this route, you are exposing your access token to a closed-source third-party server. If you are concerned about this, you may choose to either use a free ChatGPT account to minimize risks, or continue using `ChatGPTClient` instead with the `text-davinci-003` model.

The method we were using to access the ChatGPT underlying models has been patched, unfortunately. Your options right now are to either use the official OpenAI API with the `text-davinci-003` model (which costs money), or use a browser-based solution to interface with ChatGPT's backend (which is less powerful, more rate-limited and is not supported by this library at this time).

<summary><strong>2023-02-11</strong></summary>

With the help of @PawanOsman, **we've figured out a way to continue using the ChatGPT underlying models**. To hopefully prevent losing access again, we've decided to provide reverse proxy servers compatible with the OpenAI API. I've updated `ChatGPTClient` to support using a reverse proxy server instead of the OpenAI API server. See [Using a Reverse Proxy](#using-a-reverse-proxy) for more information on available proxy servers and how they work.

Please note that if you choose to go this route, you are exposing your access token to a closed-source third-party server.

~~I've found a new working model for `text-chat-davinci-002`, `text-chat-davinci-002-sh-alpha-aoruigiofdj83`. This is the underlying model that the ChatGPT Plus "Turbo" version uses. Responses are blazing fast. I've updated the library to use this model.~~

Bad timing; `text-chat-davinci-002-sh-alpha-aoruigiofdj83` was removed shortly after, possibly due to a new model somewhere out there?

Experience the power of Bing's GPT-4 version of ChatGPT with [`BingAIClient`](src/BingAIClient.js) (experimental).
**The ~~API server and~~ CLI still need to be updated to support this**, but you can [use the client](#module) directly right now.
*Please note that if your account is still wait-listed, you will not be able to use this client.*

Even though `text-chat-davinci-002-20221122` is back up again, it seems like it's constantly overloaded and returns a 429 error. It's likely that OpenAI only dedicated a small amount of resources to this model to prevent it being widely used by the public. Additionally, I've heard that newer versions are now access-locked to OpenAI employees and partners, so it's unlikely that we'll be able to find any workarounds until the model is officially released.

You may use the `text-davinci-003` model instead as a drop-in replacement. Keep in mind that `text-davinci-003` is not as good as `text-chat-davinci-002` (which is trained via RHLF and fine-tuned to be a conversational AI), though results are still pretty good in most cases. **Please note that using `text-davinci-003` will cost you credits ($).**

I will be re-adding support for the browser-based ChatGPT for the API server and CLI. Please star and watch this repository for updates.

Discord user @pig#8932 has found a working `text-chat-davinci-002` model, `text-chat-davinci-002-20221122`. I've updated the library to use this model.

## Features
- Includes an API server (with Docker support) you can run to use ChatGPT in non-Node.js applications.
- Includes a CLI interface where you can chat with ChatGPT.
- Includes clients that you can use in your own Node.js applications.
- `ChatGPTClient`: support for the official ChatGPT underlying model, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, via OpenAI's API.
  - Replicates chat threads from the official ChatGPT website (with conversation IDs and message IDs), with persistent conversations using [Keyv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv).
    - Conversations are stored in memory by default, but you can optionally [install a storage adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv#usage) to persist conversations to a database.
    - The `keyv-file` adapter is also included in this package, and can be used to store conversations in a JSON file if you're using the API server or CLI (see `settings.example.js`).
  - Supports configurable prompt prefixes, and custom names for the user and ChatGPT.
    - In essence, this allows you to make a chatbot with any personality you want.
    - This is currently only configurable on a global level, but I plan to add support for per-conversation customization.
  - Retains support for models like `text-davinci-003`
- `BingAIClient`: support for Bing's version of ChatGPT, powered by GPT-4.
  - Includes a built-in jailbreak you can activate which enables unlimited chat messages per conversation, unlimited messages per day, and brings Sydney back. ðŸ˜Š
- `ChatGPTBrowserClient`: support for the official ChatGPT website, using a reverse proxy server for a Cloudflare bypass.
  - **There may be a high chance of your account being banned if you continue to automate chat.openai.com.** Continue doing so at your own risk.

To configure which options can be changed per message (default: all), see the comments for `perMessageClientOptionsWhitelist` in `settings.example.js`.
To allow changing clients, `perMessageClientOptionsWhitelist.validClientsToUse` must be set to a non-empty array as described in the example settings file.

#### Usage
<details>
<summary><strong>Method 1 (POST)</strong></summary>

To start a conversation with ChatGPT, send a POST request to the server's `/conversation` endpoint with a JSON body with parameters per **Endpoints** > **POST /conversation** above.
```JSON
{
    "message": "Hello, how are you today?",
    "conversationId": "your-conversation-id (optional)",
    "parentMessageId": "your-parent-message-id (optional, for `ChatGPTClient` only)",
    "conversationSignature": "your-conversation-signature (optional, for `BingAIClient` only)",
    "clientId": "your-client-id (optional, for `BingAIClient` only)",
    "invocationId": "your-invocation-id (optional, for `BingAIClient` only)",
}
```
The server will return a JSON object containing ChatGPT's response:
```JS
// HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{
    "response": "I'm doing well, thank you! How are you?",
    "conversationId": "your-conversation-id",
    "messageId": "response-message-id (for `ChatGPTClient` only)",
    "conversationSignature": "your-conversation-signature (for `BingAIClient` only)",
    "clientId": "your-client-id (for `BingAIClient` only)",
    "invocationId": "your-invocation-id (for `BingAIClient` only - pass this new value back into subsequent requests as-is)",
    "details": "an object containing the raw response from the client"
}
```

If the request is unsuccessful, the server will return a JSON object with an error message.

If the request object is missing a required property (e.g. `message`):
```JS
// HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
{
    "error": "The message parameter is required."
}
```
If there was an error sending the message to ChatGPT:
```JS
// HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
{
    "error": "There was an error communicating with ChatGPT."
}
```
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Method 2 (SSE)</strong></summary>

You can set `"stream": true` in the request body to receive a stream of tokens as they are generated.

```js
import { fetchEventSource } from '@waylaidwanderer/fetch-event-source'; // use `@microsoft/fetch-event-source` instead if in a browser environment

const opts = {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        "message": "Write a poem about cats.",
        "conversationId": "your-conversation-id (optional)",
        "parentMessageId": "your-parent-message-id (optional)",
        "stream": true,
        // Any other parameters per `Endpoints > POST /conversation` above
    }),
};
```

See [demos/use-api-server-streaming.js](demos/use-api-server-streaming.js) for an example of how to receive the response as it's generated. You will receive one token at a time, so you will need to concatenate them yourself.

Successful output:
```JS
{ data: '', event: '', id: '', retry: 3000 }
{ data: 'Hello', event: '', id: '', retry: undefined }
{ data: '!', event: '', id: '', retry: undefined }
{ data: ' How', event: '', id: '', retry: undefined }
{ data: ' can', event: '', id: '', retry: undefined }
{ data: ' I', event: '', id: '', retry: undefined }
{ data: ' help', event: '', id: '', retry: undefined }
{ data: ' you', event: '', id: '', retry: undefined }
{ data: ' today', event: '', id: '', retry: undefined }
{ data: '?', event: '', id: '', retry: undefined }
{ data: '<result JSON here, see Method 1>', event: 'result', id: '', retry: undefined }
{ data: '[DONE]', event: '', id: '', retry: undefined }
// Hello! How can I help you today?
```

Error output:
```JS
const message = {
  data: '{"code":503,"error":"There was an error communicating with ChatGPT."}',
  event: 'error',
  id: '',
  retry: undefined
};

if (message.event === 'error') {
  console.error(JSON.parse(message.data).error); // There was an error communicating with ChatGPT.
}
```

#### Notes
- Method 1 is simple, but Time to First Byte (TTFB) is long.
- Method 2 uses a non-standard implementation of [server-sent event API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events); you should import `fetch-event-source` first and use `POST` method.

### CLI

#### Setup
Follow the same [setup instructions](#api-server-setup) for the API server, creating `settings.js`.

#### Usage
If installed globally:
```bash
chatgpt-cli
```

If installed locally:
```bash
npm run cli
```

ChatGPT's responses are automatically copied to your clipboard, so you can paste them into other applications.

## Using a Reverse Proxy
As shown in the examples above, you can set `reverseProxyUrl` in `ChatGPTClient`'s options to use a reverse proxy server instead of the official ChatGPT API.
~~For now, **this is the only way to use the ChatGPT underlying models**.~~ This method has been patched and the instructions below are no longer relevant, but you may still want to use a reverse proxy for other reasons.
Currently, reverse proxy servers are still used for performing a Cloudflare bypass for `ChatGPTBrowserClient`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Instructions</strong></summary>

How does it work? Simple answer: `ChatGPTClient` > reverse proxy > OpenAI server. The reverse proxy server does some magic under the hood to access the underlying model directly via OpenAI's server and then returns the response to `ChatGPTClient`.

Instructions are provided below.

<details open>
<summary><strong>https://chatgpt.hato.ai/completions</strong> (mine, <strong>currently offline</strong>)</summary>

#### Instructions
1. Get your ChatGPT access token from https://chat.openai.com/api/auth/session (look for the `accessToken` property).
    * **This is NOT the same thing as the _session token_.**
    * Automatically fetching or refreshing your ChatGPT access token is not currently supported by this library. Please handle this yourself for now.
2. Set `reverseProxyUrl` to `https://chatgpt.hato.ai/completions` in `settings.js > chatGptClient` or `ChatGPTClient`'s options.
3. Set the "OpenAI API key" parameter (e.g. `settings.chatGptClient.openaiApiKey`) to the ChatGPT access token you got in step 1.
4. Set the `model` to `text-davinci-002-render`, `text-davinci-002-render-paid`, or `text-davinci-002-render-sha` depending on which ChatGPT models that your account has access to. Models **must** be a ChatGPT model name, not the underlying model name, and you cannot use a model that your account does not have access to.
    * You can check which ones you have access to by opening DevTools and going to the Network tab. Refresh the page and look at the response body for https://chat.openai.com/backend-api/models.

#### Notes
- Since this is my server, I can guarantee that no logging or tracking is done. I can see general usage stats, but I cannot see any of your completions. Whether you trust me on this or not is up to you.
- Non-streaming responses over 60s are not supported. Use `stream: true` (API) or `onProgress` (client) as a workaround.
- Rate limit of 10 requests per second.

## Caveats
### Regarding `ChatGPTClient`
Since `gpt-3.5-turbo` is ChatGPT's underlying model, I had to do my best to replicate the way the official ChatGPT website uses it.
This means my implementation or the underlying model may not behave exactly the same in some ways:
- Conversations are not tied to any user IDs, so if that's important to you, you should implement your own user ID system.
- ChatGPT's model parameters (temperature, frequency penalty, etc.) are unknown, so I set some defaults that I thought would be reasonable.
- Conversations are limited to roughly the last 3000 tokens, so earlier messages may be forgotten during longer conversations.
    - This works in a similar way to ChatGPT, except I'm pretty sure they have some additional way of retrieving context from earlier messages when needed (which can probably be achieved with embeddings, but I consider that out-of-scope for now).
