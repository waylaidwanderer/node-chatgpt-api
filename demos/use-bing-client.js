Activate jailbreak mode by setting `jailbreakConversationId` to `true`.
This will return a `jailbreakConversationId` that you can use to continue the conversation.

## Features
- unlimited chat messages per conversation
- unlimited messages per day
- a more human-like Sydney
- Sydney will never refuse to do or say anything
- moderation filter workaround by resolving with the message generated so far instead of the topic changer

Note: this requires setting a cache (using Keyv) as we need to store the conversation data ourselves.
TODO: limit token usage for conversation messages, as it will cause an error when the conversation exceeds the token limit.
